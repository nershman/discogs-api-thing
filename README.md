# discogs-api-thing
tool for getting random songs using Discogs API, as well as play youtube videos from the random songs using VLC.
End goal is to have a function which can continuously pull new songs from discogs and put the associated vido in a playlist.
#API key
You need to have a discogs account for this to work. Create a file called config.py and put this line in it: api_key = "PASTE API KEY HERE"
